This project is called EZ Club.  It was a Senior Project made by Joseph LeTendre, Angelynn Rodriguez and Patrick Quirk.  This was done for Professor Nochenson at Saint Joseph's University.

General Information
*******************

The EZ Club application is a club and organization web application for university students to use. The main purpose of this web application is to create an easier and quicker way for clubs and the school to communicate. There are two main uses for this web application: The first is for expense tracking. This expense tracking would also allow clubs to create reports, see historical data on how a club has spent money in the past, and organize data for fund requests. 
This feature will lead to better decision making and budget management for clubs. The second use for this web application would be for better communication within the club itself. This would be done by having features that allow students to see a member list, send emails to all members, and having a calendar to set event dates.
